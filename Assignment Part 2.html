        <p>Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site, it would be the
             ideal place to come to learn more about birdwatching, whether you are a beginner 
             looking to learn how to get into birding, or an expert wanting to share ideas, tips,
              and photos with other like-minded people.</p>
           <P> So don't waste time! Get what you need, then turn off that computer and get out 
            into the great outdoors!</p>
